# TODO: what's the best, industry-standard YAML format for this kind of data?

# So there is some data associated with a label which is important (it is a name of a tree level)
# Should this be stored as a property with a name "name", or should this just be the key in the dictionary?
# Can numbers be keys in the dictionaries?

# This is a very simple matter but one should decide on a convention and be consistent.
# It is important when there is metadata associated with the container - then it's hard to distinguish a subgroup from the metadata, and sometimes there may be more complex metadata associated.
# But what if there is no metadata associated? So there is a container object explicitly containing only data?
